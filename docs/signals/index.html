    <h2>Signals</h2>
    <p>Signals are displayed on the mimic diagram as shown below.</p>

    <small>Screenshot of a signal</small>
    <p>Depending on the situation, a signal and its buttons may be shown with different colors.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Aspect</h3>
    <img src="/assets/signalaspect.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The signal's aspect may be as following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Red</b>
            <p>There is no route, stop.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Green</b>
            <p>There is a train route, passing the signal is allowed.</p>
            <p>Unlike most signalling systems, the signal will turn green as long as there is at least one track circuit with a subroute on it. The ATC will continue to supervise the train movement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Flashing Green</b>
            <p>There is a shunting route, expect stop at the next shunting panel, passing the signal is allowed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Flashing Red</b>
            <p>The route has been cancelled and is inside the safety timer. A cancelled route will be completely removed after 60 seconds has passed.</p>
            <p>This aspect is special to the ATS, and is shown as red on the physical signals.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Signal Button</h3>
    <img src="/assets/signalbutton.jpg" alt="">
    <p>If the signal is closed and fleeting is off, the signal button will display a gray background with a yellow arrow. Otherwise, the background will be white and the arrow black.</p>
    <p>Route setting functions are accessed via this button.</p>
    <h3>Fleeting Button</h3>
    <img src="/assets/fleetingbutton.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Fleeting allows the same route to be set for all trains automatically to reduce the workload of the dispatcher. Only some signals have this function.</p>
    <p>If fleeting is disabled, the fleeting button will display a gray background with a yellow F letter. Otherwise, the background will be white and the F letter black.</p>
    <p>Fleeting functions are accessed via this button.</p>
    <h3>Cancel Button</h3>
    <img src="/assets/cancelbutton.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This button is used to cancel a route.</p>
    <h3>Target Button</h3>
    <img src="/assets/targetbutton.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Sometimes, the target signal of a route may not be on the same mimic diagram as the start signal. In this case, a target button is placed.</p>
    <p>It has the same functionality as a signal button and is displayed with a thinner arrow.</p>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Green, Fleeting On</h3>
            <img src="/assets/signal.jpg" alt="">
            <p>There is a route set and fleeting is enabled.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Green, Fleeting Off</h3>
            <img src="/assets/greensignalfleetingoff.jpg" alt="">
            <p>There is a route set but fleeting is disabled.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Red, Fleeting Off</h3>
            <img src="/assets/redsignal.jpg" alt="">
            <p>There is no route set.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Commands</h2>
    <h3>Setting a route</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Click the button of the start signal. The button will start to blink.</p>
            <img src="/assets/signalstartclick.jpg" alt="">
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Click the button of the target signal.</p>
            <img src="/assets/signaltargetclick.jpg" alt="">
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The interlocking will check for any conflicting routes and occupancies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If there aren't any, the points will be moved automatically as needed and the signal will display the green aspect.</p>
